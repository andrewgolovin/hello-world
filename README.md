To you I say try it! You'll never be the same!



## Here are the steps to releasing the blindfolds of your tastebuds.

1. Find a place that sells pizza
2. Choose something that looks and sounds good to you (pizza makes all your senses dance)
3. Order the Pizza
4. Now is the hardest part. Wait for the pizza to be cooked. _Be patient don't give up! this will pay off!!!_
5. while you are waiting, crank the heater up in your car. It better be nice and toasty in there before you put your newly baked pizza there! **RESPECT YOUR PIZZA**
6. Okay! **YOUR PIZZA IS READY** pick up
7. Take the pizza box home.
8. You made it home safely. Carefully bring in the pizza home.
9. Set the Pizza on the table
10. Open the pizza box and inhale the smells of the most amazing thing on earth!
11. Look at the pizza.
12. Which slice looks the best to you?
13. Grab the best looking slice.
14. Open your mouth.
15. Put Pizza in mouth
16. Bite down on the pizza
17. Close your eyes (there is no other way to do this.) and chew the pizza slowly absorbing the juicy, creamy, mouth watering pizza.
18. Repeat steps 14 through 17 till the pizza is gone.
19. Then repeat steps 11 through 17 till the entire pizza vanishes before your eyes.
